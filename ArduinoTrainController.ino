//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.3.5
//	-------------------------------
//	
//	February 2025
//
//	Introduce options for counting interrupts per second and tracking
//	the DCC "interrupt to ISR() call" delay.
//
//	Implement a software IRQ chrono-synchronisation mechanism in the
//	DCC generator code which uses the value of the DCC Timer Counter
//	(when the ISR is fianlly called) and an "in ISR" "busy loop" to
//	ensure (mostly) that the key time critical action takes place
//	in a time reliable manner.
//
//	The above has sucessfully determined and controlled the erractic
//	DCC signal and shown that far too much CPU time is spent inside
//	"Critical" code sections.  To resolve this all ISR reliant code
//	is being migrated (where not truely time critical) to using a
//	Signal structure to indicate that the ISR has been called, then
//	the task manager to call the code outside a critical context.
//
//	This version of the firmware is now stable and executes correctly
//	with good DCC timing operating real trains successfully.
//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.3.4
//	-------------------------------
//	
//	February 2025
//
//	Redefine the use of the 8 bit timers from producing regular
//	interrupts at fixed times to producing specific timed delays
//	to suite the requirements of the moment.
//
//	Impacted modules are the Clock and DCC modules: the users of the
//	two 8 bit timers.
//	
//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.3.3
//	-------------------------------
//	
//	January 2025
//	
//	Extension includes low level SPI driver (compiles, not tested).
//	However the following items are objectives for this 0.3.3
//	version:
//
//	* A "pin database" mechanism to enable a consistency check to be
//	made that pins allocated for a specific role are free to be
//	allocated in that way when required.  This to be an extension of
//	the Pin_IO module, and will require a small extension to the
//	Pin_IO API.
//	
//	* A modification to *all* the objects to step away from
//	statically allocating tables for various roles to a system where
//	tables are allocated "on request" using a simply heap based
//	memory allocation system.
//
//	These changes should make the future porting of this code to
//	another platform less error prone, especially where other
//	platforms have the ability for a single given device (e.g. a
//	USART) to be presented at different locations on the MCUs pins.
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.3.2
//	-------------------------------
//	
//	January 2025
//	
//	Extended 0.3.1s scheduling modifications to provide fast and slow
//	schedule queues.  Whereas 0.3.1 had only a single queue which
//	released signals appended themselves to (so removing the whole
//	task manager queue system) - this version uses two queues: fast
//	and slow.  If a Signal is released from within an ISR (or simply
//	when interrupts are disabled) the Signal is placed into the fast
//	queue to expedite processing of the event that the signal indicates.
//	If the Signal was released during main line code execution (ie
//	not in an ISR) then it is placed into the slow queue.
//	
//	When the task system is asked to find another process routine to
//	call it will always pick from the fast queue if there are any
//	signals ready before picking off the the slow queue.  Through
//	this mechanism it is hoped that activities which are connected
//	with physical devices (typically serviced via an ISR) are
//	executed at a rate as close to that possible by the hardware,
//	wasting less time (leaving less dead time between actions).
//	Software based activities will operate at a slower rate but
//	are mostly tied into the HCI and therefore are subject to human
//	perception which should not notice the difference.
//	
//	Testing shows that the "weight" of fast events is so heavy that
//	the slow queue never sees any time.  Therefore the scheduler now
//	has a balancing system which ensure that, after a set number of
//	fast events a slow event must be selected.  This seems (so far)
//	to result in working firmware with a more snappy feeling.  The
//	value of the balance still needs tuning (downwards in all
//	probability).

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.3.1
//	-------------------------------
//	
//	January 2025
//	
//	Updating the minor version number as the Task Manager and Signal
//	handling module need to operate more cooperatively.  A little
//	extra complexity in this area will create a more responsive and
//	efficient task management system which should lead to faster
//	firmware execution without any significant update the client
//	module.
//	
//	This effectively removed the functionality of the task manager
//	from its own module and inserted it into the Signal module.  The
//	task manager now, effectively, only provides an interface into
//	the Signal API.
//	
//	The Signal module now maintains a list of Signals which are
//	released (at least once), and so there is no "searching" for a
//	signal that is ready - there is always one ready at the head of
//	the list. 
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.3.0
//	-------------------------------
//
//	January 2025
//
//	This version, while not (yet) fully functional is now a full
//	re-write of the firmware which became the frozen version 0.2.0.
//
//	To avoid confusion between the two very different pieces of
//	software this has now been renumbered to version 0.3.0 (ahead
//	of it actually working).
//


//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.2.3
//	-------------------------------
//
//
//	This version, really an extension of v0.2.2, sees the
//	following modifications:
//
//	*	Introduction of a simplified Dijkstra P/V signalling
//		system.
//
//	*	Introduction of a Signal controller task management
//		system.
//
//	*	Replace use of millis() and micros() with a Signal
//		based relative time system.
//
//	*	Conversion of the DCC generation code to a C++ class
//		permitting a more generic application of its code (in
//		future).
//
//	Lets be honest - this is a full rewrite of the whole firmware
//	as a move away from my earlier attempts to create something
//	resembling "real time" software towards something more structured
//	and portable.
//
//	This version is entirely different from the previous versions
//	containing systems for managing time in both "computer" and
//	"human" scales, a system for the causing "tasks" to be called
//	when and external (to that task) event raises a suitable flag.
//


//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.2.2
//	-------------------------------
//
//	This version (skipping over V0.2.1) sees the start of the
//	expansion of this code towards the combination of this
//	"Grey Box" standalone DCC controller with the "Blue Box"
//	DCC Generator used with the Fat/Thin Controller software.
//
//	The following modifications are included in this version:
//
//	o	Replace use of millis() and micros() with a flag
//		based relative time system.
//
//	o	Introduction of a flag controller task management
//		system.
//
//	o	Conversion of the DCC generation code to a C++ class
//		permitting a more generic application of its code (in
//		future).
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.2.0
//	-------------------------------
//

//
//	September 2024
//
//	Version raised to 0.2.0 to reflect status with firmware
//	exhibiting no known bugs and, within the initial parameters,
//	being fully functional.
//
//	The subsequent version 0.2.X will be associated with development
//	for support of PoM actions (Program On Main) that will
//	facilitate *most* of the actions which a true programming track
//	permits.  However, this firmware will still not support a
//	dedicated "Programming Track".
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.1.7
//	-------------------------------
//
//	September 2024
//
//	Debugging the LCD driver code; specifically the "screen
//	buffer" code where a very specific "edge case" literally
//	put data across the screen.
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.1.6
//	-------------------------------
//
//
//	August 2024
//
//	Redesign and reorganise the display to facilitate the ability
//	to display "per object" extended information.  This is primarily
//	aimed at the "Cab" object where the need to display function
//	status information is required.
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.1.5
//	-------------------------------
//
//	August 2024
//
//	Still delaying the move to version 0.2.  This continues to be
//	effectively and "alpha" version.
//
//	Consolidate the firmware configuration aspects of the source
//	code - creation of the "Configuration.h" file.
//
//	Revise the design of the menu presentation - reduce with to
//	create a wider area for the controlled objects display.
//
//	Debug display "artifacts" that seem to be "overflowing" from
//	the objects area into the status area.
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.1.4
//	-------------------------------
//
//	August 2024
//
//	Redesign the status area of the LCD to remove the uptime component
//	and expand load display to two lines one for each district.
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.1.3
//	-------------------------------
//
//	August 2024
//
//	Version 0.1.2 was short lived, and was primary created to
//	cover the expansion of the firmware to incorperate the
//	linkage between the user interface and the under lying
//	DCC generator code.
//
//	This has now been, initially, completed with the first
//	DCC related action being initiated from the keypad (power
//	off).  Other basic actions have been coded but cannot be
//	tested.
//
//	This versions main task is the creation of the menu execution
//	routines and, most especially, the creation of the 'number
//	input' mode to enable the creation of mobile and static decoder
//	objects.
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.1.2
//	-------------------------------
//
//	August 2024
//
//	Physical HCI devices now coded and (so far) appear to work
//	reliably.  The menus and object page coding is largely
//	completed.
//
//	This version marks the start of integrating the HCI with the
//	under lying DCC generation code.  Some reorganisation of the
//	DCC code is required to enable the injection of DCC commands
//	"from the side" rather than the USB connection.
//

//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.1.1
//	-------------------------------
//
//
//	Key physical HCI devices are now supported:
//
//	o	Rotary control
//	o	4x4 Keypad
//	o	20x4 LCD Display
//
//	The objective of this version is to establish the HCIs visual
//	and functional elements with the aim of creating the simplest
//	interaction possible while still allowing a wide range of
//	actions to be available.
//


//
//	Arduino Train Controller V0.1
//	-----------------------------
//
//	This initial version of the Train Controller takes as its base
//	the latest (as of July 2024) version of the Arduino DCC Generator
//	firmware and make the following changes:
//
//	Simplification:
//	o	The options for differrent forms of support hardware
//		are reduced to just the Arduino Uno (and by binference
//		the Nano) and the Arduino Mega2560.
//	o	The "DCC Board" is now *only* the motor driver shield.
//		The bespoke 6 district control board has been dropped.
//	o	Only a single district is supported, though this will
//		naturally support multiple engines (as per normal DCC
//		functionality).
//	o	DCC programming track support to be removed.
//
//	Extensions:
//	o	A "human interface" will be incorperated into the firmware
//		to enable the operator to interact with the firmware
//		directly:
//
//		.	A rotary knob with turn for speed and click for
//			direction control
//
//		.	A joystick up/down/left/right/click for menu
//			navigation
//
//		.	A keypad for numerical data entry
//
//	o	Restore the DCC++ serial interface (simplied) to optionally
//		restore the interface to JMRI running on a USB attached PC
//
//	The above changes will not all happen in Version 0.1.
//

//////////////////////////////////////////////////
//						//
//	Previously in "Arduino DCC Generator"	//
//	=====================================	//
//						//
//////////////////////////////////////////////////

//
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.5.1
//	----------------------------
//
//	Simplify the LCD display to make 'District Power' section
//	more meaningful.
//
//	The 'Bar Chart' output by the districy letters is simply
//	too coarse to provide meaningful information.  While being
//	left in the code (selectable with a compile time flag) the
//	output will be changed to a two digit in the range 00 to 99
//	which will represent the percentage load (of maximum) being
//	experienced.
//
//	Simpler, more accurate and more informative.
//
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.5
//	--------------------------
//
//	Fix the error in the algorithm that converts the logical
//	accessory addresses into the main address and sub address
//	pair.  The error was cause by initially asserting that the
//	accessory address zero (0) was the first usable address,
//	and so the actual accessory address 0:0 (main address, sub
//	address) was mapped to logical address 1.
//
//	Purchase of the ECU ECoS Command Station has revealed that
//	this assumption (through seemingly correct) is not how the
//	industry views things, where the accessory address 1:0 is
//	mapped to logical address 1.
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.4.3
//	----------------------------
//
//	Added in the 'stationary' symbol to the LCD status screen
//	so that engines doing speed '0' have their direction shown
//	as '=' in keeping with the FatControllers displays.
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.4.2
//	----------------------------
//
//	Extend symbolic CV programming table to include
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.4.1
//	----------------------------
//
//	Extended the timing in the "Logical CV" modification code
//	to allow time for any reply indication to take place before
//	the next command is sent.
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.4
//	--------------------------
//
//	Functional extensions for this version:
//
//	December 2023
//
//		Added new "{...}" protocol to support the configuration
//		of DCC decoders using logical parameter names rather than
//		explicit direct CV updates.
//
//		This change has been brought in to make it simpler to
//		configure decoders with just the DCC Generator at hand
//		and not require an additional host software package to
//		achieve this.
//
//		This is not to say that this system will provide an entire
//		range of abilities in this field, but will ensure that
//		basic programming can be more easily achieved.
//
//		Removed March 2023 'doubling up' code when realising that
//		the code *already* repeats commands multiple times, by
//		default so the March 2023 change was pointless and stupid.
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.3.3
//	----------------------------
//
//	Modifications for this version:
//
//	December 2023
//
//		Added the "Write State" to mobile decoder command.  See
//		the 'W' command for details.
//
//		Removed all pretense of needing to provide DCC++
//		compatibility.  Who was I kidding?
//

//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.3.3
//	----------------------------
//
//	March 2023
//
//		Flexible constant handling using the EEPROM to keep
//		'configured' constants.  This has required a migration
//		of constants towards the top of the source file so that
//		the default values are easily tuned.
//
//		Constant configuration accessed and modified via an
//		extension to the communications protocol (see the
//		'Q' command).
//
//	August 2023
//		
//		Added adjustable constant value to permit control of
//		the dynamic load reporting (constant name "dynamic_load
//		_updates).  Primarily implement to facilitate stopping
//		stream of output data to simplify debugging.
//

//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.3.2
//	----------------------------
//
//	March 2023
//
//	Included the set CV bit command '[U cv bnum value]' to the system
//	and also doubled up the command *inside* the command transmission
//	as there is some evidence to suggest that duplicate sequential
//	commands are required before the decode is obliged to reply.
//

//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.3.1
//	----------------------------
//
//	March 2023
//
//	Incorporated improved confirmation detections code which (largely)
//	reduces the averaging codes impact in the detection process.
//

//
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.3
//	--------------------------
//
//	Feb 2023
//
//	This version sees a rewrite of the "programming confirmation
//	mechanism" and an extension of the mechanism that translates
//	DCC byte encoded commands into bit streams as required by the
//	generator code in the interrupt routine.
//
//	Changes in 1.3:
//
//	o	Source code now starting to be placed into separate
//		modules.
//
//	o	System Serial Library replaced with own configurable
//		USART interrupt driven solution.
//
//	o	The "long preamble" flag has been replaced in the DCC
//		command processing (the conversion from byte codes to
//		bit streams) with "preamble bits" and "postamble bits"
//		values.  This change has enabled the CV programming
//		code to introduce a meaningful delay after a specific
//		DCC command in which any reply from the decoder is more
//		readily and reliably determined.
//
//	All-in-all the change in version number to 1.3 is justified as
//	these changes are significant and affect a number of systems in
//	the firmware. 
//
//	Arduino DCC Generator V1.2
//	--------------------------
//
//	Feb 2023
//
//	There has been no real version tracking within this sketch for
//	no honestly good reason.  Since version 0.x and through versions
//	1.0 and 1.2 there have been many changes.  This version should
//	probably be called version 1.5 or 1.6, but isn't.  This source
//	code is in retirement phase awaiting replacement with the DCC
//	generator V2.1 (why no V2.0, because that approach was also set
//	to one side).
//
//	Anyway..
//
